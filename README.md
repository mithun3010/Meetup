The project was to design and implement a database that presents a list of experts in any field and to provide a Mapping Service that gets several Places of Interest along the route from the userâ€™s location and the destination.

The main aim of this project is to let the user choose an expert in any field he needs and give the places of interest along their locations so that they can meet.  

Every user information is stored in the external database. In the Mapping service, users can choose the location of the restaurant from the route (Eg:  Restaurant within 10 miles of the route). The user need not type complicated latitudes and longitudes for getting directions. They can simply add the address in text format. Latitudes and Longitudes for that address are automatically generated by Google Maps API.

RouterBoxer API:

The RouteBoxer class generates a set of LatLngBounds objects that are guaranteed to cover every point within a specified distance of a path, such as that generated for a route by the DirectionsService class. The primary use case for this class is to support implementing Search along a route against a Spatial db that supports bounding box queries.
